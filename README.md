## 📚 What I Practiced

This project helped me sharpen the following:

- ✅ **Advanced DOM manipulation** — `classList`, `scrollIntoView`, `closest`, `dataset`
- ✅ **Event delegation** — Efficient event binding using bubbling and matching
- ✅ **Intersection Observer API** — Scroll-triggered effects and sticky nav
- ✅ **Performance best practices** — Lazy loading and minimal DOM repaint
- ✅ **Reusable logic & clean code structure**
